## About

This is my website that showcases a collection of projects that I developed, ranging from voxel terrain generators to 3D game engines, all created with JavaScript and other web technologies.

### Projects

This year I started working on these 3 projects:

- **Voxel Terrain Generator**: A JavaScript-based project that procedurally generates 3D terrains based on 2D height map images. Explore landscapes created pixel by pixel from height map data.
- **3D Game Engine (3DMOTOR2)**: A JavaScript game engine inspired by the classic game Doom. Experience real-time rendering and transformation of 3D objects using matrix and vector manipulation.
- **Raycaster Engine**: Explore environments reminiscent of Doom with this raycaster engine, built entirely from scratch in JavaScript.

Now, I am currently working on some API backend projects to add variety.

### Interactive Showcase

Visit [My portfolio](http://projectsio.000.pe/) to explore these projects and more. Each project includes a detailed description, interactive demonstrations, and access to the source code on GitHub.

### Design Note

Please note that the design of the portfolio project is still under construction. I will continue working to improve the user experience and aesthetics of the website.
